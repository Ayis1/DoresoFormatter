# DoresoFormatter
For fun project for parsing CSV data from the chrome extension AHA - Music: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-song-finder-for/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en

##**How it works**
The AHA - music extension that inspired this mini project will let you listen and identify any song playing in your browser. 
Identification history is then saved in a .csv file.
This formatter can read this csv file and give you a text document with usefull youtube links, rather than the links directing them to their site. 
You can also create a playlist with all the songs identified.

##**How to use**
Run the project and use the testdata in the project structure.
If you want to access the yotuube playlist creation feature you will need to obtain your own API key from Google.
Can be obtained by following the steps on their documentation https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
